<h2>NB: </h2>
<p>
  This is a copy of my final project during Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp. As a team of four with 
  <a href="https://github.com/ZShuqi">ZShuqi</a> 
  <a href="https://github.com/ayubfarahh">Ayubfarahh</a> and 
  <a href="https://github.com/eseegerc">Eseegerc</a>, 
  we developed this Rails prototype app for two weeks. You can see the 2-weeks-results deployment 
  <a href="https://www.photobuddies.me">here</a>. 
  I chose to keep working on this project to keep practicing without interfering with my teammates' version.
