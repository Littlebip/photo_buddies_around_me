<h2>NB: </h2>
<p>
  This is a copy of my final project during Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp. As a team of four with 
  <a href="https://github.com/ZShuqi" target="_blank">ZShuqi</a> 
  <a href="https://github.com/ayubfarahh" target="_blank">Ayubfarahh</a> and 
  <a href="https://github.com/eseegerc" target="_blank">Eseegerc</a>, 
  we developed this Rails prototype app for two weeks. You can see the 2-week deployment version
  <a href="https://photo-buddies.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here</a>. 
  I had the honor to pitch the demo of our app in front of everybody and you can see the recording if it 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IprbbdpBw0&ab_channel=LeWagon" target="_blank">here</a>.
  I chose to keep working on this project to keep practicing without interfering with my teammates' version.

<h2>About the project:</h2>
<p>
  PhotoBuddies is an application organizing local photography communities. 
  It enables photography amateurs to share their work and get in touch with their community.
  Users can browse through people and art in their community, post photo galleries, share their favorite photo spots nearby and take part in photography events.
